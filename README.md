# Neuronal-Network-for-MRI-Brain-Tumor-Detection

The medical diagnosis brain tumor is received with the magnetic resonance imaging technique. Magnetic fields and radio waves are used to generate images of the texture of the brain. Thereby morbid changes in the brain could be detected. 
Here a neuronal network is implemented for the brain tumor detection of such MRI images. 

## Datasets:

The used dataset are founded on Kaggle. You can find it here:

- https://www.kaggle.com/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri

The first dataset contains two folders “yes” and “no”. The no folder contains 98 brain MRI images that are non-tumorous and the yes folder contains 155 brain MRI images that are tumorous.

The second dataset contains four folders “glioma_tumor”, “meningioma_tumor”, “pituitary_tumor” and “no_tumor”. The data was primary divided in test and training folder, but here there are merged together. Images in the glioma, meningioma and pituitary folders represent different types of brain tumors. In this implementation no classification between these different types is performed. In the glioma folder are 926, in meningioma 937, in pituitary 901 and in the no folder 500 brain MRI images. 

**Total dataset contains therefore:**

**598** brain MRI images without brain tumor

**2919** brain MRI images with brain tumor
